## Description:
This repository contains a report compiled from a dataset of crimes in the USA 
including analysis and machine learning predictions. It concludes that some states
can, statistically, be more dangerous than others and informs readers. This may 
help some nervous travellers feel more at ease and inform goverments where targeted
